Simple tab bar application with integrated slide out menu in Swift
==================================================================
The slide out menu is realised using SWRevealController (see: https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController)  
The accordion menu inspired by StackOverflow (see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35394191/making-simple-accordion-tableview-in-swift) but was ported to Swift 2.2 and is much more simplified by using structs.
